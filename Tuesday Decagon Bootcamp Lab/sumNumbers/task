Tobi was tasked to get a list of numbers seperated by comma, unfortunately his keyboard malfunctioned
in the process hitting the comma (,) key, random characters that are not numbers were added to the collection instead of the expected commas

what is need from Tobi is a collection of the numbers so you can build a calculator for these collection.
but we are currently faced with a challenge, how do we weed off the characters and leave you with the numbers?

Your new obligation is to help us build a calculator to handle Tobi's results

given a string of length N containing numbers and non-numbers, 
build a calculator that extracts the numbers in the collection
and return the sum of the extracted numbers

For Example;
sumNumbers(‘1weudh56jdnbfskjn788sdhkfbs90’) => 935

note: Do not use Regular Expressions for this task as our system do not support it.

to solve this problem
1.loop through the string if the string is a Number, push it to the new array
2.also if the subsequent element is also a number, push it to the array to form a single number
3.add the numbers together to get their sums

1.split the str to form an array
